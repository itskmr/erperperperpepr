# School ERP System - Complete Authentication & Production Fixes

## üéØ Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes applied to the School ERP system to resolve the 500 Internal Server Error in student registration, implement proper authentication with school context isolation, and make the entire backend production-ready.

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Student Registration 500 Error - FIXED**
**Problem**: `POST http://localhost:5000/register/student/register 500 (Internal Server Error)`

**Root Causes Identified**:
- Database schema mismatch in Registration model
- Missing school context validation
- Improper error handling for foreign key constraints
- Optional schoolId field causing relationship issues

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Enhanced error handling for Prisma database operations
- Added proper school context validation before registration
- Implemented comprehensive foreign key constraint handling
- Added school existence and status verification
- Improved file upload error handling

### 2. **Authentication System - COMPLETELY OVERHAULED**
**Previous State**: Basic authentication with hardcoded values
**New State**: Production-ready JWT authentication with role-based access control

**Key Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ JWT token validation with proper expiry handling
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (admin, school, teacher, student, parent)
- ‚úÖ School context isolation for multi-tenant architecture
- ‚úÖ Automatic school ID extraction from authenticated users
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling for authentication failures

### 3. **School Context Implementation - NEW FEATURE**
**Feature**: All operations now automatically use the logged-in user's school context

**Implementation**:
- `getSchoolIdFromContext()` function extracts school ID based on user role
- All database queries filtered by school context
- Cross-school data access prevention
- Admin override capabilities for system-wide operations

  protect, 
  authorize('admin', 'school', 'teacher'),
  requireSchoolContext,
  attendanceController.markAttendance
);
```
