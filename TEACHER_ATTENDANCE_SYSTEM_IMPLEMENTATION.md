# Teacher Attendance System - Complete Implementation

## üè´ Overview

A comprehensive Teacher Attendance Management System with robust school-based isolation, designed for multi-tenant school management environments. This system allows schools to efficiently track teacher attendance, generate detailed reports, and maintain complete data isolation between different schools.

## üîß Features Implemented

- **Data Validation**: All operations validate teacher-school relationships

### üìÖ Daily Attendance Management
- **Teacher List Display**: Shows all active teachers for the authenticated school
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Mark teachers as Present, Absent, or Late
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by department, designation, or search by name
- **Check-in/Check-out Times**: Optional time tracking with working hours calculation
- **Notes Support**: Add contextual notes for each attendance record
- **Bulk Operations**: Save multiple teacher attendance records in one operation

### üìä Comprehensive Reporting
- **Summary Reports**: Aggregated attendance statistics by teacher
- **Detailed Reports**: Day-by-day attendance breakdown with full history
- **Date Range Filtering**: Generate reports for any custom date range
- **Teacher-specific Reports**: Individual teacher attendance analysis
- **Department-wise Reports**: Group reports by department/subject

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### TeacherAttendance Model
```prisma
model TeacherAttendance {
  id          Int              @id @default(autoincrement())
  date        DateTime         @db.Date
  status      AttendanceStatus // PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE
  notes       String?          @db.Text
  checkInTime DateTime?
  checkOutTime DateTime?
  workingHours Float?
  
  // Relations with school isolation
  teacherId   Int
  teacher     Teacher          @relation("TeacherAttendanceRecords", fields: [teacherId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  schoolId    Int              // Critical for multi-tenant isolation
  school      School           @relation("SchoolTeacherAttendance", fields: [schoolId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  // Audit fields
  markedByUserId Int?
  markedAt    DateTime         @default(now())
  createdAt   DateTime         @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime         @updatedAt

  // Constraints
  @@unique([date, teacherId]) // Prevent duplicate attendance for same teacher on same date
  @@index([date, teacherId])
  @@index([schoolId, date])
  @@index([schoolId, teacherId])
  @@index([teacherId, date])
}
```

### Updated Relations
- **Teacher Model**: Added `teacherAttendance` relation
