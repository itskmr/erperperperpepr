## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes:
```prisma
model Student {
  // Removed image URL fields - now in Documents model
  // studentImageUrl, fatherImageUrl, etc. removed
}

model Documents {
  // All image paths stored here
  studentImagePath String?
  fatherImagePath String?
  motherImagePath String?
  // ... etc
}
```

### API Endpoints:

#### Registration Student Management:
- `POST /register/student/register` - Create registration (with files)
- `GET /register/student/allStudent` - Get all registrations
- `PUT /register/student/update/:formNo` - Update registration (with files)
- `DELETE /register/student/delete/:formNo` - Delete registration
- `GET /register/student/stats` - Registration statistics

#### Student Management:
- `GET /api/students` - Get all students
- `GET /api/students/:id` - Get student by ID
- `PUT /api/students/:id` - Update student (comprehensive)
- `DELETE /api/students/:id` - Delete student
- `GET /api/students/uploads/*` - Serve uploaded files

### Frontend Architecture:

#### Registration Form:
- Multi-step wizard (4 steps)
- File upload with preview
- Real-time validation
- Delete confirmation modal

#### Student Edit Form:
- 7-step comprehensive form
- Nested object handling
- File upload integration
- Progress tracking
- Print functionality

### File Upload Architecture:

#### Backend (Multer):
```javascript
const documentFields = [
  { name: 'documents.studentImage', maxCount: 1 },
  { name: 'documents.fatherImage', maxCount: 1 },
  // ... all document types
];
```

#### Frontend (FormData):
```javascript
const submitData = new FormData();
// Add text fields
Object.keys(formData).forEach(key => {
  submitData.append(key, formData[key]);
});
// Add files
Object.keys(selectedFiles).forEach(key => {
  submitData.append(key, selectedFiles[key]);
});
```

## Security and Validation

### Backend Security:
- **Authentication required**: All routes protected
- **Authorization checks**: School context validation
- **File validation**: Type and size restrictions
- **Input sanitization**: Proper data validation
- **Error handling**: No sensitive data exposure

### Frontend Security:
- **Token management**: Automatic token refresh handling
- **File validation**: Client-side file type/size checks
- **CSRF protection**: Proper credentials handling
