# Teacher Diary Routing Fixes - Complete Summary

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Teacher Diary Missing Navbar**
**Problem**: Teacher diary route `/teacher/diary` was not wrapped in Layout component, so no navbar was showing.

**Fix**: Updated teacher diary routes to include Layout wrapper:
```tsx
<Route
  path="/teacher/diary"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['teacher']}>
      <Layout userRole={userRole} onLogout={handleLogout}>
        <TeacherDiary />
      </Layout>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

### 2. **Added Parent Teacher Diary View**
**Problem**: Parents had diary link in navbar but no corresponding route.

**Fix**: Added parent diary route:
```tsx
<Route
  path="/parent/academics/diary"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['parent']}>
      <Layout userRole={userRole} onLogout={handleLogout}>
        <DiaryViewer userRole="parent" />
      </Layout>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

### 3. **Added Student Teacher Diary View**
**Problem**: Students had diary link in navbar but no corresponding route.

**Fix**: Added student diary route:
```tsx
<Route
  path="/student/academics/diary"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['student']}>
      <Layout userRole={userRole} onLogout={handleLogout}>
        <DiaryViewer userRole="student" />
      </Layout>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

### 4. **Fixed Teacher Diary Viewer Route**
**Problem**: Teacher diary viewer was using wrong userRole prop.

**Fix**: Updated to use 'school' role for proper access:
```tsx
<Route
  path="/teacher/diary/view/:id"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['teacher']}>
      <Layout userRole={userRole} onLogout={handleLogout}>
        <DiaryViewer userRole="school" />
      </Layout>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```
