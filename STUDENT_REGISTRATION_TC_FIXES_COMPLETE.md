# Student Registration and TC Form Fixes - Complete Resolution

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Student Registration Form Validation Error
**Problem**: When clicking "Next" button in Basic Information tab, the form showed "Father name is required" error, but father name field is in the Parent Details tab (step 3).

**Root Cause**: The validation logic in `validateCurrentStep()` was checking for father name in step 1 (Basic Information) instead of step 3 (Parent Details).

**Solution**: 
- Updated validation logic in `SchoolERP-Frontend-main/src/pages/StudentRegister.tsx`
- Moved father name validation from step 1 to step 3
- Only admission number and full name are required in step 1 (Basic Information)
- Father name is now properly validated in step 3 (Parent Details)

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
const validateCurrentStep = () => {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  if (currentStep === 1) {
    // Only admission number and full name are required in basic information step
    if (!formData.fullName.trim()) errors.push('Full Name is required');
    if (!formData.formNo) errors.push('Admission Number (Form Number) is required');  
  }
  
  if (currentStep === 3) {
    // Father name is required in parent details step
    if (!formData.fatherName?.trim()) errors.push("Father's Name is required");
  }
  
  return errors;
};
```

### 2. TC Form Authentication Errors (401 Unauthorized)
**Problem**: TC form API calls were failing with 401 Unauthorized errors:
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/tcs?schoolId=1 401 (Unauthorized)
Error: Failed to fetch certificates
```

**Root Cause**: All TC form API calls in `data.ts` were missing authentication headers.

**Solution**: 
- Added Bearer token authentication to all TC form API functions
- Added proper error handling for 401 responses with token cleanup
- Updated the following functions in `SchoolERP-Frontend-main/src/components/Schools/TCForm/data.ts`:
  - `fetchIssuedCertificates()`
  - `createCertificate()`
  - `deleteCertificate()`
  - `updateCertificate()`
  - `getStudentIdFromAdmissionNumber()`
  - `getTcIdFromAdmissionNumber()`

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Example for fetchIssuedCertificates
export const fetchIssuedCertificates = async (): Promise<IssuedCertificate[]> => {
  try {
    const schoolId = await getSchoolId('', '');
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token') || localStorage.getItem('authToken');
    
    if (!token) {
      throw new Error('Authentication required. Please log in again.');
    }
    
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/tcs?schoolId=${schoolId}`, {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      if (response.status === 401) {
        localStorage.removeItem('token');
        localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
        throw new Error('Authentication failed. Please log in again.');
      }
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch certificates');
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching issued certificates:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### 3. School Model Enhancement
**Problem**: User requested to add affiliate and website fields to the School model.

**Solution**: 
- Updated Prisma schema to include new fields:
  - `affiliate String?` - For school affiliation information
  - `website String?` - For school website URL
- Created database migration: `20250601055347_add_affiliate_website_to_school`
- Updated seed.js to populate these fields with sample data

**Schema Changes**:
```prisma
model School {
  id          Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  schoolName  String       @default("Unknown")
  email       String       @unique
  password    String
  username    String       @unique @default(cuid())
  code        String       @unique @default("SC000")
  address     String       @default("Not Provided")
  contact     BigInt       @default(0)
  phone       String       @default("0123456789") @db.VarChar(15)
  principal   String       @default("Unknown")
  image_url   String?      @db.Text
  established Int          @default(2000)
  affiliate   String?      // New field for school affiliation
  website     String?      // New field for school website
  role        Role         @default(SCHOOL)
  status      String       @default("active")
  lastLogin   DateTime?
  // ... other fields and relations
}
```

**Seed Data Update**:
```javascript
const school = await prisma.school.create({
  data: {
    id: 1,
    schoolName: 'Springfield Elementary School',
    email: 'school@school.com',
    password: await bcrypt.hash('123456', 10),
    code: 'SES001',
    address: '123 Education Street, Springfield',
    contact: 5550222123n,
    phone: '5552220123',
    principal: 'Seymour Skinner',
    established: 2020,
    affiliate: 'Springfield Education Board', // New field
    website: 'https://www.springfield-elementary.edu', // New field
    role: 'SCHOOL',
    status: 'active',
    lastLogin: new Date(),
    createdAt: new Date(),
    updatedAt: new Date()
  }
});
```
